HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE P NAVEEN RAO Writ Petitions Nos.26137, 22303, 26207 & 26236 of 2019
COMMON ORDER:
Heard Sri A.Venkatesh, learned counsel for petitioners in W.P.Nos.26137, 26207 and 26236 of 2019
(hereinafter referred to as counsel for petitioners), and Sri Krishna Mohana Sikharam learned
counsel for petitioners in W.P.No.22303 of 2019/ respondent no.3 in W.P.Nos.26137, 26207 and
26236 of 2019 (hereinafter referred to as counsel for respondent), and learned Government Pleader
for Revenue for official respondents.
2. In W.P.Nos.26137, 26207, 26236 of 2019 petitioners are aggrieved by action of registering
authority in not registering and receiving the sale deeds dated 01.08.2018, each for Ac.1.00 guntas
in Sy.No.133 of Kothwalguda village. In W.P.No.22303 of 2019, petitioners are opposing release of
pending documents concerning land in Sy.Nos.130, 131 and 133 of Kothwalguda village. In
W.P.Nos.26137, 26207, 26236 of 2019 land to an extent of Acs.3.00 guntas in Sy.No.133 of
Kothwalguda village is only in issue.
3. Facts as averred by petitioners in W.P.Nos.26137, 26207, 26236 of 2019 would disclose, the
petitioners purchased Ac.1.00 guntas each in Survey No.133, situated in Kothwalguda Village,
Kavvaguda Gram Panchayat, Shamshabad Mandal, Ranga Reddy District through Respondent No.4.
Respondent No.3 is the owner of the land and respondent No.4 is holding power of attorney
executed by respondent no.3. Accordingly, sale deeds with respect to such sale on individual extents
of land executed by Respondent No.4 were presented before the Sub Registrar, Shamshabad/
Respondent No.2 for registration and release of the said documents. These Writ petitions are filed
aggrieved by the inaction of the respondent no.2 in registering and releasing the sale deeds dated
01.08.2018 executed between the petitioners and their vendors.
4.1. According to learned counsel for petitioners the action of Respondent No.2 in refusing to
register the document on the ground that O S No. 1260 of 2017 is filed in the Court of XIII
Additional District and Sessions Judge RR District at L.B. Nagar by Respondent No. 3 praying to
cancel Agreement of Sale-cum- General Power of Attorney with possession dated 17.09.2014
executed in favour of respondent no.4 as illegal; would amount to arbitrary exercise of power and
authority.
4.2. According to learned counsel, there was no interlocutory order of restraint against registration
of deed of conveyance in the said suit at the time of presentation of the documents that could have
impeded the execution of the Sale Deed in favour of petitioners. He would further urge that the
Hon'ble XIII Additional District and Sessions Judge RR District at L.B. Nagar granted interlocutory
orders of status quo, to be maintained by the parties, on 12.6.2019 whereas the said Sale Deed dated
01.08.2018 was executed prior to the interlocutory order of 12.06.2019. He would submit that based
on a caution notice/legal notice dated 01.08.2018 issued to Respondent No.2 by Respondent No.3,
documents could not have been refused for registration and release the said Sale Deeds. Even the
interlocutory order only applies to protection of the property by both the parties until the disposal of

the suit.
4.3. It is further contended that as the Registering Authority is not a party to the suit, the injunction
order dated 12.6.2019 in I A No. 1324 of 2017 is not binding on the Registering Authority and
therefore, the Registering Authority cannot refuse to register the documents presented before him
on the ground that injunction order is operating.
4.4. Learned counsel for petitioner placed reliance on the following decisions:
Thummalachetty Builders and Developers Pvt. Ltd v. Commissioner and Inspector General of
Stamps and Registration and ors1; Tirumala Venkata Reddaiah Chowdary and others Vs Potla
Krishna Prasad and others2; Kaliaperumal Vs Rajagopal and another3; Parasa Nagamalleswara Rao
Vs The Sub Registrar, Eluru and another4; and Union of India and others Vs Ashok Kumar
Aggarwal5.
5. Per contra, learned Government Pleader would submit that in view of S.O.219 (b), which governs
procedure to be followed by registering authorities, whenever the Registering Authority is informed
that on the same property which is the subject matter of document presented before the Registering
Authority, competent Court granted injunction/ restraint order, he cannot register and release the
document. He would submit that it is not necessary 1 MANU/AP/0582/2008 2
MANU/AP/0852/2008 3 (2009) 4 SCC 193 4 WP 4099 and 4229 of 2013 dt 12.2.2013 5
MANU/SC/1222/2013 that Registering Authority should be a party to the suit. He would further
submit that the two decisions relied upon by learned counsel for petitioners are no more good law in
view of the subsequent decision of this Court in Venkannagiri Naveen Rao v. Joint-Registrar
Sangareddy and Anr6. He also submitted that the Commissioner issued clarification orders on
10.3.2010 and in view of the same the action of the Registering Authority is valid.
6. Learned counsel Sri Krishna Mohana Sikharam for respondents further submitted that in view of
injunction order granted by trial Court, registering authority cannot be compelled to process the
documents presented for registration and no mandamus can be issued directing registering
authority to register and release the document when civil litigation is pending on the same property.
7. The issue for consideration is whether action of Sub Registrar/2nd respondent in refusing to
process the documents presented before him which cover Acs.3.00 guntas of land in Survey No.133
of Kothwalguda village on the ground that trial Court granted injunction is justified ?
8. It is not in dispute that by the time documents were presented for registration, there was no
injunction granted by trial Court. However, document was not processed and released before
injunction order was granted, and as of now injunction order is in force.
6 (2012 (4) ALD 142)
9. The role of Registering Authority is to process the document presented before him for registration
in accordance with Indian Stamp Act 1899 and the Indian Registration Act, 1908. While processing

B.Prabhakar Reddy vs The State Of Telangana Revenue ... on 23 January, 2020

the document, it is not open to him to go into minute details on title to property or other aspects of
the transaction. He has to scrutinize the document as per the provisions of the Stamp Act,
Registration Act, the Registration Rules and Standing Orders. His role is confined to authentication
of a transaction between two parties present before him. He is not concerned with sanctity of the
said transaction. In view of Section 17 read with Section 49 of the Registration Act, any transaction
on immovable property whose value is 100/- and more has no legal validity if it is not registered. By
virtue of registration of a document, the world is informed that two parties to the transaction are
bound by the terms of the document. If transaction relates to a landed property and is a deed of
conveyance it would be amounting to vendor accepting conveyance of right vested in him on the
property to vendee.
10. The Registration Act and the Rules made under the Act are silent on the course to be adopted by
Registering Authority if litigation is pending on the landed property on which a document is
presented before him for registration. The Government notified standing orders which guide the
Registering Authority to process the document presented before them. For these cases, S.O. 219 (b)
is relevant.
11. The Standing Order 219 reads as follows:
"An order restraining a person from alienating certain property does not operate as a prohibition to
the registering officer against the registration of a document executed by such person effecting such
property,
(b)"If the Andhra Pradesh High Court or any other Civil Court restrains a person from alienating a
property and if such orders are brought to the notice of the Registering Officer or served on the
Registering Officer, the Registering Officer is estopped from going ahead with the Registration".
12. The scope of this standing order and the effect of injunction order on processing a document
presented before Registering Authority, when he is not a party, was considered by this Court in the
following decisions:
12.1. In Thummalachetty Builders and Developers Pvt. Ltd (supra), this Court held as under:
"17. Though the learned Assistant Government Pleader for Revenue representing
respondent No. 3, sought to justify the order of respondent No. 3 and respondent No.
1, refusing to register the document, by placing reliance on S.O. No. 219, which
prohibited the Registering Officer from entertaining documents for registration when
there is an injunction order granted by the competent Civil court or the High Court,
the fact remains, the said S.O. 219 can be pressed into service only when there is an
order of injunction granted by the competent civil Court or High Court against the
Registering Officer from entertaining any document for registration in respect of the
property covered by its orders. In the instant case, neither the petitioner nor the
Registering Officer has been made party to the suit in O. S. No. 455 of 2005 on the
file of 1 Additional Senior Civil Judge, Ranga Reddy District, and the injunction

B.Prabhakar Reddy vs The State Of Telangana Revenue ... on 23 January, 2020

orders dated 26-4-2005 granted therein operated only against the parties to the said
suit, and not to any other person, much less the Registering Officer. This apart, it is
brought to the notice of the Court by the learned Counsel for he petitioner that the
said suit was dismissed for default on 1-4-2008. In fact, under the provisions of the
Registration Act, the Registering Officer, cannot refuse to register a document when
presented for registration, except in the case, the property sought to be registered
under the document, is covered by the properties mentioned in Section 22A of the
Registration Act, and in the event, the Registering Officer, refuses to register a
document, he has to pass an order under Section 71 of the Registration Act by
recording his reasons for refusal to register, which is appeal able under Section 72 of
the Registration Act, and any person aggrieved by the order passed in the appeal by
the appellate authority, has to approach the competent Civil Court under Section 77
of the Registration Act."
12.2. The same principle is reiterated in Tirumala Venkata Reddaiah Chowdary and Ors. (supra).
"10. In the instant case, though the petitioners filed suit in O.S. No. 495 of 2008 on
the file of the Junior Civil Judge, Vijayawada, and obtained interim injunction orders
in IA. No. 269 of 2008, the fact remains, they obtained such an order only against the
respondent No. 1, and not respondent No. 2-Sub Registrar. S.O. 219 of the A.P.
Registration Manual, prohibits the Registering Officer from registering documents
only when there is an order of injunction operating against him. The petitioners,
admittedly, leave alone obtaining orders of temporary injunction against respondent
No. 2-Sub Registrar, have not even made him party-defendant in the said suit. The
petitioners having not made respondent No. 2- Sub Registrar as party-defendant in
the suit filed by them, and there being no order of interim injunction granted
operating against them by the civil Court, cannot seek directions to respondent No.
2-Sub Registrar not to register any documents, in respect of the property covered by
the orders in I.A. No. 269 of 2008 in O.S. No. 495 of 2008, and no exception can be
taken to the action of respondent No. 2 in taking steps to stop the registration of the
property, particularly when under the provisions of the Registration Act, the
Registering Officer, is not empowered to refuse to register a document when
presented for registration, except in the case, the property sought to be registered
under the document, is covered by any of the properties mentioned in Section 22-A of
the Registration Act, and in the event, the Registering Officer, refuses to register a
document, he has to pass an order under Section 71 of the Registration Act by
recording his reasons for refusal to register, which is appealable under Section 72 of
the Registration Act, and any person aggrieved by the order passed in the appeal by
the appellate authority, has to approach the competent civil Court under Section 77 of
the Registration Act. Therefore, no directions can be given to the registering officer
not to register the documents to be presented in respect of the land in question."
12.3. This very issue has come up for consideration in Venkannagiri Naveen Rao. Learned single
Judge considered earlier view of this Court in Tirumalashetty Builders followed in Tirumala Venkata
